        <h1>We aspire to be the most player-focused<br /> game company in the world</h1>
        <p>
          Riot Games was founded in 2006 to develop, publish, and support the most player-focused games in the world. In 2009, we released our debut title, League of Legends, to worldwide acclaim. League has gone on to be the most-played PC game in the world and a key driver of the explosive growth of esports.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With League in its second decade, we’re continuing to evolve the game while delivering new experiences to players with Teamfight Tactics, Legends of Runeterra, VALORANT, League of Legends: Wild Rift, and multiple work-in-progress titles. In addition, Riot Forge gives developers access to Riot’s IP to create games like Ruined King and plenty of other adventures across Runeterra. We’re also expanding the world of Runeterra through multimedia projects across music, comic books, board games, and Arcane, our Emmy Award-winning animated series.
